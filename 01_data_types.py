#TASK 1:
#Firstly, I created my float variable. This variable is our tester.
my_float = 7.89

#Next, I made a variable equal to the integer and in the space I put the float variable inside.
my_int = int(my_float)

#Finally I printed the original float and the converted integer and printed this to the console. The console should show the conversion between the original float and the finale result it being a integer. The int function truncates the decimal part.
print(my_float)
print(my_int)
